    - Be: Asked why the character was called "king woman" instead of queen
    - Caleb: Explained it was because in the tribe they only had kings, not queens
- Conclusion

    - Be: Used examples like "there are only men" vs. "there isn't any coffee"
    - Caleb: Practiced forming sentences with these structures
    - Be: Pointed out that in Portuguese people often use "tem" (there is) for everything, but in English the verb must agree with the noun
