### City preferences and quality of life

Discussion about Caleb's experiences living in different cities

- Details
    
    - Caleb: Prefers Lorena as it's a medium-sized city - not too big like Rio (which had stressful traffic) and not too small like Itayandu
        
    - Caleb: In Itayandu (population ~15,000), everything closes at 6 PM
        
    - Caleb: In Rio, he spent 2-3 hours in traffic daily
        
    - Caleb: In Lorena, he can reach places in 15 minutes and stores are open until 10 PM
        
    - Be: Compared Lorena to the "Goldilocks" story - not too big, not too small, but just right
        
- Conclusion
    
    - Lorena offers better quality of life with less traffic and more conveniences
        
    - Lorena is also conveniently located about one hour from Itayandu where Caleb's parents live
        

### Present perfect continuous tense

Detailed practice of the present perfect continuous tense structure

- Details
    
    - Be: Identified that Caleb incorrectly said "I'm living here for 3 years" instead of "I've been living here for 3 years"
        
    - Be: Explained that language acquisition should focus on what "sounds right" rather than memorizing grammar rules
        
    - Caleb: Practiced forming sentences with "I've been" structure
        
    - Be: Demonstrated how "for + time period" typically requires present perfect continuous
        
- Conclusion
    
    - Caleb needs to practice recognizing and using the present perfect continuous tense
        
    - The teacher recommended noticing this structure while reading or listening to English content
        

### Past tense negation

Practice with different forms of past tense negation

- Details
    
    - Be: Worked on the difference between "I didn't start" and "I haven't started"
        
    - Be: Explained that time markers like "yesterday" require simple past (didn't) not present perfect (haven't)
        
    - Caleb: Practiced forming negative sentences in past tense
        
    - Be: Emphasized recognizing patterns rather than memorizing rules
        
- Conclusion
    
    - Caleb should pay attention to which time markers go with which tense structures
        
    - Learning should happen through exposure and pattern recognition
        

### Learning approach philosophy

Discussion about effective language learning methods

- Details
    
    - Be: Explained that learning happens "on the edge of knowledge" - not too easy, not too difficult
        
    - Be: Emphasized that making mistakes is essential for learning
        
    - Be: Recommended noticing patterns in authentic English rather than memorizing grammar rules
        
    - Caleb: Mentioned he bought a World of Warcraft book in English that he plans to read
        
- Conclusion
    
    - The teacher will customize lessons based on Caleb's specific needs
        
    - Learning should focus on acquiring language naturally through exposure
        
    - Perfection is not required before moving to more advanced structures
