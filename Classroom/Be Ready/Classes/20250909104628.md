    - Be: Provided examples of other uncountable nouns like "bread" and "paper"
        
    - Danny: Learned that you can't say "two insurances" just as you can't say "two moneys"
        
    - Be: Clarified that for paper, you would say "sheets of paper" to count it
        
- Conclusion
    
    - Some nouns in English are uncountable (insurance, money, bread)
        
    - These nouns don't take "a/an" or plural forms
        
    - To quantify uncountable nouns, you need to use measure words (like "sheets of paper")
        

### Additional expressions

Brief discussion of other useful expressions

    - Be: Explained "life-changing decision" as another useful expression
        
- Conclusion
    
    - "Run the risk of" is used instead of "take a risk of"
        
    - "Break the speed limit" is the correct way to express exceeding the speed limit
