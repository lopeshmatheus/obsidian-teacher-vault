- Conclusion
    
    - The medical context provided practical vocabulary for Luiz
        
    - The activity served as preparation for the grammar focus of the lesson
        

### Present perfect vs. present perfect continuous

- Details
    
    - Be: Presented examples contrasting "I have painted the kitchen" vs. "I have been painting the kitchen"
        
    - Be: Emphasized the importance of time expressions like "for two days" that trigger specific structures
        
    - Luiz: Practiced forming sentences with both structures
        
    - Be: Explained that Portuguese doesn't make the same distinction between these structures
        
- Conclusion
    
    - When using time expressions like "for two days" or "all morning," use present perfect continuous
        
    - When using "now," use present simple
        
    - Luiz should focus on identifying patterns rather than memorizing rules
