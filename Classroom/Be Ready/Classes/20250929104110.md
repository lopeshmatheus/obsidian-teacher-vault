## Key takeaways

- The class focused on the correct usage of "can/could" versus "be able to" in English
- Students should use "can/could" for general abilities and "be able to" for specific situations
- After modal verbs like "might," "will," etc., "be able to" must be used instead of "can/could"
- The class also covered proper usage of "there is/are" versus "there isn't/aren't" with singular and plural nouns
- Additional grammar points included the correct use of "the other" versus "another" and practicing past perfect tense

## Discussed topics

### Homework review

The teacher began by asking Luana about her homework results on "have been" usage.

- Details
    
    - Luana: Mentioned her score was "horrible" and less than half correct
    - Be: Reassured her that sometimes getting poor results is part of the learning process
- Conclusion
    
    - The homework was intentionally difficult to identify areas needing practice
    - The teacher used the homework results to guide the lesson content

### Can/Could vs. Be able to

The teacher and student worked through examples to understand the difference between these expressions.

- Details
    
    - Be: Explained that "could" is used for past abilities while "was able to" is used for specific situations
    - Luana: Practiced with examples like "I could play the guitar when I was a child"
    - Be: Clarified that after modal verbs (might, will, would), only "be able to" can be used
- Conclusion
    
    - Use "can/could" for general abilities
    - Use "be able to" for specific situations or achievements
    - After modal verbs, always use "be able to" (e.g., "I might be able to go to the cinema")

### There is/are vs. There isn't/aren't

The teacher guided Luana through the correct usage of these expressions with singular and plural nouns.

- Details
    
    - Be: Demonstrated that "there is" is used with singular nouns and "there are" with plural nouns
    - Luana: Practiced with examples like "there is a dog on the street" and "there aren't any dogs on the street"
    - Be: Pointed out that Portuguese uses the same structure for both singular and plural, making this distinction challenging
- Conclusion
    
    - "There is" pairs with singular nouns; "there isn't any" with uncountable nouns
    - "There are" pairs with plural nouns; "there aren't any" with plural nouns
    - This structure differs from Portuguese, requiring special attention

### The other vs. Another

The teacher helped Luana understand the difference between these expressions.

- Details
    
    - Be: Explained that "another room" is used for singular, while "the other rooms" is used for plural
    - Luana: Practiced translating phrases like "a outra sala" and "as outras salas"
    - Be: Emphasized that "another rooms" is incorrect
- Conclusion
    
    - "Another" is only used with singular nouns
    - "The other" can be used with both singular and plural nouns
    - Practice is needed to master these distinctions

### Personal experiences with live events

The teacher asked Luana about her experiences attending live events.

- Details
    
    - Luana: Shared that she attended art exhibitions including Van Gogh and Leonardo da Vinci
    - Luana: Described rooms with sunflowers and miniatures of Leonardo's inventions
    - Luana: Mentioned attending a women's soccer match at Morumbi stadium (São Paulo vs. Corinthians)
    - Be: Asked follow-up questions about her soccer team preference
