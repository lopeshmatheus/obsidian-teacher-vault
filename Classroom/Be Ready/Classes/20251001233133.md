## Key takeaways

- English grammar focus on "some" vs "any" usage in questions and negative statements
- When offering something in a question, use "some" (e.g., "Do you need some help?")
- In most other questions and negative statements, use "any" (e.g., "Is there any coffee?")
- Country names usage: "the U.S.A." vs "Brazil" (without "the")
- Compound country names often use "the" (e.g., the UK, the U.S.A.)
- Active learning is more effective than passive consumption for language improvement
