## Discussed topics

### English comparatives and superlatives

The teacher guided Luiz through understanding and using comparative and superlative forms correctly.

- Details
    
    - Be: Taught the difference between "older than" (comparative) and "the oldest" (superlative)
        
    - Luiz: Initially confused "oldest than" but learned the correct forms
        
    - Be: Emphasized that "older than" should be thought of as one concept rather than separate words
        
    - Be: Explained that "more" is used with "than" while "the most" is used for superlatives with longer adjectives
        
- Conclusion
    
    - Comparative form: older than, better than, slower than, more powerful than
        
    - Superlative form: the oldest, the best, the slowest, the most powerful
        

### Transportation vocabulary

The teacher and student reviewed vocabulary related to transportation and getting around a city.

- Details
    
    - Be: Asked Luiz to translate various transportation terms from Portuguese to English
        
    - Luiz: Successfully translated most terms including "public transport," "rush hour," "traffic jam"
        
    - Be: Corrected Luiz on phrases like "get stuck in traffic" vs. "stay in traffic"
        
    - Luiz: Learned expressions like "on the way to work" vs. "on the way home"
        
- Conclusion
    
    - Key vocabulary included: get around London, public transport, rush hour, traffic jam, get stuck in traffic, speed limit, cycle lane, traffic lights, motorway, car crash
        

### Pronunciation practice

The teacher helped Luiz distinguish between similar-sounding words in English.

- Details
    
    - Be: Played audio examples of word pairs with similar sounds
        
    - Luiz: Practiced distinguishing between words like "cheap/chip" and "ship/sheep"
        
    - Be: Explained the difference between short and long vowel sounds
        
    - Be: Noted that these distinctions don't exist in Portuguese, making them challenging
        
- Conclusion
    
    - The distinction between sounds is important but context often helps clarify meaning
        
    - Paying attention to native speakers is the best way to improve pronunciation
        
    - These distinctions are very specific and not always critical for communication
        

### Reading comprehension: Transportation race in London

The class read and discussed a text about a race across London using different transportation methods.

- Details
    
    - Luiz: Read about a BBC show called "Top Gear" that organized a race across London
        
    - Be: Asked comprehension questions about the text
        
    - Luiz: Understood that the race compared different transportation methods (boat, car, bike, public transport)
        
    - Be: Helped convert miles per hour to kilometers per hour for better understanding
        
- Conclusion
    
    - The text described a competition to find the fastest way to cross London during rush hour
        
    - Each participant used a different mode of transportation
        
    - The boat reached speeds of 70 mph (112 km/h) while the car was stuck at 18 mph (28 km/h)
        

### Local transportation discussion

The teacher and student briefly discussed transportation options in Luiz's city.

- Details
    
    - Be: Asked about public transportation in Luiz's city
        
    - Luiz: Explained that his city near São Paulo only has buses, no subway
        
    - Luiz: Mentioned there used to be a train station but it's no longer used for passengers
        
    - Be: Taught Luiz to say "near São Paulo" instead of more complex phrases
        
- Conclusion
    
    - Luiz's city primarily relies on buses for public transportation
        
    - The train infrastructure exists but is now only used for cargo, not passengers
