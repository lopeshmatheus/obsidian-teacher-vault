## Key takeaways

- Present Perfect Continuous tense is used with "for" (I have been studying for 2 years)
    
- Present Perfect tense is used with "in" (I haven't spoken in 2 months)
    
- Strong adjectives are more intense versions of regular adjectives (tired → exhausted, angry → furious)
    
- "Take part in" is a formal alternative to "participate"
    
- "Since" and "for" require different verb structures but both often trigger Present Perfect tenses
    
- Luiz needs to complete homework from the previous class
    

## Discussed topics

### Present Perfect vs Present Perfect Continuous

Discussion on the differences between these tenses and when to use each one

- Details
    
    - Be: Explained that "I haven't spoken in 2 months" describes when an event started
        
    - Be: Clarified that "I haven't been speaking for 2 months" implies continuity throughout the period
        
    - Luiz: Practiced with examples like "I haven't seen Juan in 2 months"
        
    - Be: Emphasized that "for" typically requires Present Perfect or Present Perfect Continuous
        
- Conclusion
    
    - When using "for," use Present Perfect Continuous (have been doing) or Present Perfect (have done)
        
    - When using "in" with negative statements about time, use Present Perfect (haven't done)
        
    - The choice depends on whether you're emphasizing the start point or the continuous nature

    - Be: Noted that words similar to Portuguese often belong to formal English
        
    - Luiz: Recognized that "converse" sounds strange compared to "talk" in everyday speech
